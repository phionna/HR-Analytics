# HR-Analytics
Introduction to Python Programming Final Project

The aim of the project was to take a dataset containing Human Resource information and generate actionable insights through sorting and visualizing the data. Specifically, my project explores 3 main questions with regards to the dataset:
1)	Is there a relationship between pay and performance (adjusted for position)?
2)	What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?
3)	What are the best recruiting sources for the company to invest in?

I found the Human Resource dataset from Kaggle, it was created by professors at the New England College of Business for the class “HR Metrics and Analytics”. The dataset revolves around a fictitious company, called Dental Magic, and the core data set contains names, age, gender, marital status, date of hire, reasons for termination, position title, pay rate, manager name, and performance score etc.
